# Configuring Commerce

## Config Settings

Commerce supports a number of [config settings](config-settings.md). Like Craftâ€™s config settings, you can override their default values in a `config/commerce.php` file.

```php
return [
    'purgeInactiveCartsDuration' => 'P1D',
];
```

## Aliases

| Alias | Description
| ----- | -----------
| `@commerceLib` | The path to `vendor/craftcms/commerce/lib/`

## Environmental Configuration

Some Commerce settings should be defined on a [per-environment basis](/3.x/config/#environmental-configuration).

- System Settings
    - General Settings
        - Email
            - **Status Email Address**
            - **From Name**
        - Subscription Settings
            - **Billing detail update URL**

## PHP Constants

### `COMMERCE_PAYMENT_CURRENCY`

This constant can be used to lock a valid payment currency ISO code, which otherwise defaults to the primary currency.

## Project Config

Craft 3.1 introduced the [**project config**](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/project-config.html), a sharable configuration store that makes it easier for developers to collaborate and deploy site changes across multiple environments.

Craft Commerce stores the following items in the project config:

- Commerce general settings
- Email settings
- PDF settings
- Gateways settings
- Order field layout
- Order Statuses
- Product types
- Fields and field groups
- Subscription field layout

Not everything should be stored in the project config. Some items are considered content, which will change in production.

The following items are not stored in the project config:

- Discount promotions
- Sales promotions
- Shipping categories
- Shipping zones
- Shipping methods and rules
- Subscription plans
- Subscriptions elements
- Tax categories
- Tax zones
- Tax rates
- Order elements
- Products & Variant elements
