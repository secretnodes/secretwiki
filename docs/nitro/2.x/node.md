# Node & npm

## Installing Dependencies

Nitroâ€™s [`npm`](commands.md#npm) command lets you to run any npm command without having Node or npm installed on your host machine.

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/my-craft-project
$ nitro npm install
  â€¦ checking /Users/oli/dev/docs/package.json âœ“
  â€¦ pulling docker.io/library/node:14-alpine âœ“
Running npm install

### Specifying a Node Version

You can specify a node version for Docker image used by the `npm` command:

```bash
$ nitro npm --version=12 install
```

## Configuring Node Server Ports

If your project runs a node server that needs to be accessed from a web browser, youâ€™ll need to do one of two things:

1. Run the server on your host machine to use whatever ports youâ€™d like. (This means installing node+npm on your machine instead of running it in a Nitro container.)
2. Configure the server to use one of Nitroâ€™s available proxy ports.

Nitro provides ports 3000 and 3001 for each site by default. (You can change these ports using Nitroâ€™s [environment variables](customizing.md#nitro-environment-variables).)

Configuring the server usually means youâ€™ll need to provide the site with a base URL for the node server, and instructing the node server itself to utilize a specific hostname and port.

A webpack configuration using hot module reloading, for example, would need to use port 3000 and `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`:

```js
{
  // ...
  devServer: {
    // ...
    port: 3000,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

Binding the port to `0.0.0.0` means it will be available on all interfaces, meaning both inside and outside the web container.

::: tip
Depending on your front end build setup, you may also need to provide your site with a base URL for the node server. In this case, it would mean changing `http://localhost:8080` to `http://starterblog.nitro:3000`.
