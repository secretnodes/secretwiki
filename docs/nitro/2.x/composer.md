## Using Composer 1

Each Nitro site comes with Composer 2 installed by default. If you need to use Composer 1, you can SSH into the site and update it manually:

1. Navigate to your project:
    ```sh
    $ cd ~/dev/my-craft-project
    ```
2. SSH into your siteâ€™s container with all-powerful `root` user permissions:
    ```sh
    $ nitro ssh --root
    ```
3. Update Composer to version 1:
    ```sh
    $ composer self-update --1
    ```
4. Optionally exit your siteâ€™s container and return to your host machine:
    ```sh
    $ exit
    ```

::: warning
Because site containers are ephemeral, youâ€™ll need to do this again any time you rebuild its Docker container!
